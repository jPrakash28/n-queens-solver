# n-queens-solver

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the N-Queens problem for any board size N between 4 and 20. It uses roulette-wheel selection, one-point crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions over generations. The program tracks the best fitness and solution found in each generation and visualizes the final solution as a board with queens (Q) and empty spaces (_). Users can input different values for N and observe the algorithm in action.
